"""The declared 1.0 external-contract policy and the source facts it binds to.

The 1.0 compatibility contract has human-readable policy and inventory
documents in the private ``itambox/design-docs`` repository. The public
repository keeps the reviewed machine-readable projection in
``scripts/contract_policy_manifest.json``. A promise about a surface nobody
enumerated is unfalsifiable, and an enumeration that drifts from source is worse
than none -- so this module derives the surfaces from source and the gate in
``check_contract_policy.py`` compares them against that manifest.

Three design choices make the result trustworthy rather than decorative:

* **Derivation, not transcription.** Enum values, ``ITAMBOX_*`` names, SCIM
  routes, custom permission codenames, and capability declarations are read out
  of the source tree with :mod:`ast` and a small number of anchored regular
  expressions. Nothing here imports Django, so the gate runs on a bare
  interpreter with no database and no settings module.
* **Closed enums carry their frozen values here.** A Stable enum the policy
  declares ``CLOSED`` records its values in this reviewed module *as well as* in
  the published document. Changing such an enum then takes three coordinated
  edits -- source, policy, document -- which is exactly the review a frozen
  1.x value set is supposed to attract. An ``OPEN`` enum records none: values
  may be added in a minor release, but the addition must still be published.
* **The exclusions are explicit.** Every ``ITAMBOX_*`` name the application
  reads -- from the environment or from a Django settings attribute, anywhere in
  the first-party tree -- is either published as contract-bearing or listed in
  :data:`EXCLUDED_SETTINGS` with a reason. A name that is in neither is a
  finding, so a new setting cannot arrive unclassified.

This module deliberately does **not** re-check what the capability registry
already proves. ``itambox/tests/test_capability_slices.py`` compares the live
registry against the capability rows in the machine-readable manifest; that
runs under Django and owns grade/activation/limitation drift. What is added
here is the one thing the registry does not publish: the *contract class* each
capability is sold under, and the exclusions attached to it.

The gate never writes the manifest. Updating it is a reviewed edit alongside the human-readable private policy documents.
