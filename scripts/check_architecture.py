"""Fail-closed architecture boundary gate: layering, direction, and cycles.

ITAMbox's structure is declared in ``scripts/architecture_policy.py``: a layer
for every first-party module and a matrix saying which layer may import which.
This gate builds the first-party import graph twice -- once from module-top
imports and once including function-body imports -- and blocks on an import
cycle or on an edge the matrix forbids.

Both graphs block from the first run. Moving an import into a function defers
*when* a coupling happens, not *whether* it exists, so a violation that is only
visible once deferred imports are counted is still a violation. ``TYPE_CHECKING``
imports are in neither graph; they never execute, and a typing-only back edge is
the sanctioned fix for a real cycle.

Accepted debt lives in ``scripts/architecture_baseline.json``. Every row carries
an owning ``area:*`` label and a machine-readable ``disposition``: ``debt`` rows
also record the tracking issue that will remove them and a stated removal
direction, so the baseline is a work list rather than a suppression file, while
``accepted`` rows record a stable rationale and no false removal promise. The
removal issues of every ``debt`` row must be the open ones recorded in the
reviewed ``scripts/architecture_issue_states.json`` snapshot, refreshed with
``--refresh-issue-states``; the gate itself never reaches the network. Two
things can never enter the baseline: a ``domain-model -> presentation`` edge,
which has no representation at any severity, and a newly observed identity,
which has to be hand-reviewed into the file rather than absorbed by
``--write-baseline``.

Three exit codes, and they mean different things. ``0`` is a clean graph. ``1``
is a policy regression a contributor fixes. ``2`` is a result nobody should
trust: a malformed baseline, a drifted policy fingerprint, an unclassifiable
module, a source file that will not parse, or the wrong interpreter.
