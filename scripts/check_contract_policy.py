"""Blocking gate: the published 1.0 contract still describes this source tree.

Run from the repository root::

    python scripts/check_contract_policy.py
    python scripts/check_contract_policy.py --list

``--list`` prints the surfaces the gate derives so a reviewer can see what the
inventory is being compared against; it checks nothing and always exits 0.

There is deliberately **no write mode**. Both published documents are reviewed
prose with tables a human maintains; generating them at run time would turn the
contract into a mirror of whatever the code happens to say this week, which is
the opposite of a promise. When this gate fails, the fix is either to restore
the surface or to edit the document -- both of which are review events.

The gate imports no Django and touches no database, so it runs on a bare
interpreter alongside the other repository gate suites.
