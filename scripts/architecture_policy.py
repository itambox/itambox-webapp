"""Layering, dependency direction, and cycle policy for first-party ITAMbox code.

ITAMbox is one Django project made of a platform substrate and ten domain
applications. The substrate may not name a domain, a model may not reach up into
the presentation it is rendered by, and nothing may import a composition root.
This module encodes that structure as data -- a layer per module, a matrix of
permitted directions, and a closed registry of rule identifiers -- so the gate in
``check_architecture.py`` can decide any edge without judgement.

Three properties shape the implementation:

* **It never imports application code.** Everything is derived from the source
  text through ``ast`` and from the dotted module name. Importing the tree would
  execute Django, and a gate that needs a database is a gate that stops running.
* **It never probes the filesystem while resolving.** Module existence is
  answered only by exact-case membership in the in-memory discovered set. A
  case-insensitive filesystem would otherwise resolve
  ``from assets.models import Asset`` to ``assets.models.asset`` on Windows and
  to ``assets.models`` on Linux, and the two baselines could not be shared.
* **It classifies every participating module or refuses to answer.** There is no
  default layer. A module the rules do not cover is a policy gap to close, not a
  row to accept, and the gate exits 2 rather than reporting a clean graph.

Import direction is checked over two graphs. The module-top graph is what runs
when the module is imported; the effective graph adds function-body imports,
because moving an import into a function defers *when* the coupling happens and
not *whether* it exists. Both block. ``if TYPE_CHECKING:`` imports are in
neither: they never execute, and a typing-only back edge is the sanctioned fix
for a real cycle rather than a defect.
