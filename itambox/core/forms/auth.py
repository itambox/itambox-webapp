"""Authentication forms for the interactive login page.

The stock :class:`~django.contrib.auth.forms.AuthenticationForm` ships two
different failure messages (``invalid_login`` / ``inactive``). Rendering both a
template-level banner and the form's own non-field error produced *two* panels
for one failed attempt, and the ``inactive`` variant discloses that the account
exists. One generic message is used for every failed local login instead.
