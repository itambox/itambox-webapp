"""SeedHistoryMixin — drives realistic, back-dated MSP change history.

Replaces the old hand-written ``_seed_changelog`` with engine-powered saves so
every ObjectChange carries a genuine diff produced by the same serializer the
live application uses.

Wire-up (in seed_data.py):
1. Import and add to Command's base classes:
       from core.management.commands._seed.history import SeedHistoryMixin
       class Command(SeedHistoryMixin, BaseCommand): ...
2. In ``_seed_all``, replace ``self._seed_changelog()`` with
       self._engine = ChangeLogEngine(stdout=self.stdout, style=self.style)
       self._simulate_history()
3. Delete (or leave inert) the old ``_seed_changelog`` method.
