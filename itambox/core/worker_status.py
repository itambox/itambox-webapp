"""Best-effort detection of a running django-q cluster.

Webhook and notification deliveries are enqueued to the background worker
(``python manage.py qcluster``). When no worker runs, tasks pile up in the broker
queue and nothing is ever delivered — the single most common reason the
Webhook/Event-Rule features look like a no-op. These helpers let the UI surface
that state instead of failing silently.

Cluster heartbeats live in the cache configured for django-q (``Conf.CACHE``).
With a local-memory cache the web process and the qcluster process hold *separate*
caches, so a running worker is invisible from here. In that case we report
``detectable=False`` rather than a misleading "offline".
