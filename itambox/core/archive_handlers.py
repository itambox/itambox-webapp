"""App-registered archive/restore handlers for the model-agnostic callers.

Soft delete is not always a single-row flag flip. An *aggregate root* (an asset
holder, an asset, a kit) owns child rows whose lifecycle has to move with it:
some must refuse the archive while they are still active, others must be
detached so that no live row keeps pointing at an archived parent, and the rows
touched need their own audit entries. Those decisions belong to the aggregate's
own domain service, never to a generic view.

The single delete view, the bulk delete view, the REST API delete path and the
recycle-bin restore views all resolve their model from the URL and therefore
cannot import a domain service. An app registers its aggregate service here
instead, exactly like ``core.purge_handlers`` does for hard purges. Every model
WITHOUT a registration keeps the plain leaf semantics (``obj.delete()`` /
``obj.restore()``), so a registration is opt-in and changes nothing else.

A registered handler is called as ``handler(obj, actor=..., request=...)`` and
returns whatever its own result type is (aggregate archive services return an
:class:`ArchiveResult`); the generic callers only distinguish success from a
refused operation.

This module is also the shared plumbing every aggregate service builds on, so a
new aggregate plugs in instead of copying the pilot (#619):

* :class:`ArchiveResult` and :class:`ArchiveBlocked` - the one result and
  refusal type of every aggregate service;
* :class:`ArchiveOperation` - the correlation handle of one archive operation;
* :func:`lock_aggregate_root` - the scoped, fail-closed row lock a service takes
  first;
* :class:`ArchiveRelation` / :class:`ArchiveBehaviour` - the per-aggregate
  behaviour table (ARCHIVE, REFUSE, DETACH, KEEP) that a registration must
  carry and that :func:`archive_table_problems` (system check ``core.E003``)
  verifies against the live model graph, so a relation added later cannot
  silently escape its aggregate's table.
