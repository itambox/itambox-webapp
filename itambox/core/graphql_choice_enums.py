"""Choice enums for the read-only GraphQL schema.

Strawberry derives enums from Django ``choices`` itself, but its generated
names (``<App><Object><Field>Enum``) and member names differ from the contract
this schema published before the port (``<App><Object><Field>Choices`` with
graphene's ``to_const`` member names).  The helper below rebuilds that contract
from the model field, so enum names, member names and member descriptions stay
identical without duplicating the choice lists by hand.
