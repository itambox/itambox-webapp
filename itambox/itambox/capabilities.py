"""The declarative capability registry.

A capability is one shippable contract: a named slice of the product with a
declared maturity, a declared way of being switched on, and a declared owner.
Domain applications register their own entries from ``AppConfig.ready``; this
module never learns what any of them are.

That blindness is the whole design. The registry stores dotted strings and
opaque callables the domain hands it, and resolves neither at registration
time, so ``itambox.capabilities`` imports no application, no model, and no
presentation code. The architecture gate classifies it as ``framework``, where
naming a domain application is a hard error -- see the private
``itambox/design-docs`` repository for the architecture policy.

Three rules make the declarations trustworthy rather than decorative:

* **Stable means always on.** A Stable capability carries no probe and cannot
  report inactive. If a slice can be switched off, it is not Stable.
* **Non-Stable means probed.** Beta and Experimental entries must say how a
  deployment turns them on, and must declare at least one limitation.
* **Security-critical means undeactivatable.** An entry that guards a boundary
  may not have an off switch, so it may not carry a probe at all.

Activation is evaluated live and never cached: a probe reports what a
deployment looks like *now*. Probes are expected to observe -- read a setting,
count rows -- never to mutate. A probe that raises fails closed, and only its
exception *type* is ever published, so a probe that touches a credential cannot
leak one into a diagnostics row.
