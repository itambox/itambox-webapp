    """Build the label/count/url rows for an object's reverse relations.

    H4 batching: the legacy implementation issued one ``.count()`` query per
    auto-created reverse relation (~10-15 separate COUNTs per detail GET). Each
    of those counts went through the related model's *default* manager
    (``_default_manager.get_queryset()``) — i.e. tenant scoping + soft-delete
    filtering — because Django's reverse related manager subclasses the related
    model's default manager and calls ``super().get_queryset()`` before applying
    the FK filter.

    We reproduce the *identical* counts with far fewer queries by annotating the
    single object's row with one correlated ``Subquery`` COUNT per reverse FK /
    one-to-one relation. Each subquery is built from the related model's
    ``_default_manager`` and filtered ``<fk>=OuterRef(<target>)``, so it carries
    exactly the same WHERE clauses (tenant + soft-delete) the old ``.count()``
    applied. Independent per-relation subqueries (not one multi-join aggregate)
    avoid the cartesian fan-out that would inflate counts. The outer query uses
    ``_base_manager`` purely to fetch the single pk row — the subqueries do their
    own default-manager scoping, so the outer manager's filtering does not affect
    any displayed count.

    Reverse many-to-many relations are NOT batched: their count needs a
    through-table join, which a plain FK subquery cannot reproduce, so we keep
    the per-relation ``.count()`` for those (a handful at most). Any relation
    whose subquery can't be built safely also falls back to ``.count()``.
