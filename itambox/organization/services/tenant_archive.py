"""Per-aggregate archive service for :class:`Tenant` (#619, step 5).

The approved behaviour table for this aggregate (design section 2.8):

* **REFUSE** while the tenant still owns live business records (assets,
  requests, suppliers, inventory, kits, licenses, locations, sites, holders,
  contacts, cost centers, software, subscriptions, procurement, custody
  templates, audit sessions) or manages live child tenants. The refusal is a
  typed :class:`ArchiveBlocked` and nothing has been written when it is raised.
  A full decommission of a tenant stays a separate, non-archive operation.
* **ARCHIVE** the soft configuration rows (roles, user groups, event rules,
  webhook endpoints, report templates, notification channels, alert rules,
  saved filters, asset tag sequences) through each row's own ``save()``. A
  restore brings back exactly the rows archived at the tenant's own timestamp.
* **DETACH** live resource grants in both directions (owner and grantee): they
  are revoked and a restore never re-grants access.
* **HARD DELETE** the regenerable rows (jobs, dashboards, alert logs and report
  generation archives) as an explicit list.
* **KEEP** memberships, API tokens, scheduled reports, role grant scopes,
  journal entries, attachments, webhook deliveries and expiry evidence. Token
  authentication and membership lookups already ignore an archived tenant, so
  these rows are inert while the tenant is archived and active again when it is
  restored; no data is lost by the archive.
