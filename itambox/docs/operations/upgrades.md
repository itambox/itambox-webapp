# Updating a deployment

ITAMbox is pre-release and currently ships as source, not as a published container image. There is no compatibility or version-skipping guarantee yet. Treat every target revision as a potentially breaking change and test it against a restored copy of production first.

## Preflight

1. Select and review an exact target commit.
2. Review the repository-root `CHANGELOG.md`, migrations, and configuration changes between the deployed and target commits.
3. Capture the current revision with `git rev-parse HEAD` and retain or export the currently running application image; rebuilding an old commit later may resolve newer base images or dependency versions.
4. Take a complete [database, media, and secret backup](backup-restore.md) and verify that it can be read.
5. Plan a maintenance window; prerelease migrations are not guaranteed to be compatible with the old application.

## Source-built Compose update

```bash
set -Eeuo pipefail
writers_stopped=false

report_failed_upgrade() {
  rc=$?
  trap - EXIT
  if ((rc != 0)) && [[ "$writers_stopped" == true ]]; then
    echo "Upgrade failed after writers were stopped. Do not admit traffic; inspect the stack and follow the rollback plan." >&2
  fi
  exit "$rc"
}
trap report_failed_upgrade EXIT

# Record the rollback revision before changing the checkout.
ROLLBACK_REVISION=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
printf 'rollback revision: %s\n' "$ROLLBACK_REVISION"

# Fetch and select the reviewed target revision explicitly.
git fetch origin
TARGET_REVISION='full-reviewed-target-commit-sha'
git checkout --detach "$TARGET_REVISION"

# Build the new application and frontend assets from source.
docker compose build --pull

# Stop writers, migrate with the new image, and restart.
writers_stopped=true
docker compose stop app worker
docker compose run --rm app python manage.py migrate
docker compose up -d
writers_stopped=false

# Inspect startup after the deployment.
docker compose ps
docker compose logs --tail=100 app worker
```

`collectstatic` runs while the application image is built, so the included stack does not need a separate post-deployment collection step.

## Rollback

Do not assume a Django migration can be reversed safely. A migration may be irreversible or may discard data when reversed. The reliable rollback is the complete pre-update set:

1. Stop the application and worker.
2. Restore the retained previous image, or check out and rebuild the recorded previous revision. A rebuild is not necessarily byte-identical when base images or ranged dependencies have moved.
3. Restore the matching database, media, and secrets using [Backup and restore](backup-restore.md).
4. Start the prior application and verify login, attachments, encrypted fields, and background processing.

If an update fails before any migration runs, returning to the previous source revision and rebuilding may be sufficient. Once a migration starts, use the tested backup-based rollback unless that specific migration has been reviewed and proven reversible.

## Identifying the deployed revision

`/api/status/`, the login page, and the application footer report ITAMbox version metadata. That value identifies the declared software version (currently prerelease metadata), not the exact deployed Git commit. Use it as a sanity check and record the source revision separately in the deployment system:

```bash
curl -fsS https://itam.example.com/api/status/
git rev-parse HEAD
git status --short
docker compose images
```

Keep the checkout clean and pin the recorded commit so a later rebuild uses the same source.
