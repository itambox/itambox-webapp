# Updating a deployment

ITAMbox is pre-release and ships as source and, starting with `v1.0.0-beta.2`, as the official container image published with each tagged release (`ghcr.io/itambox/itambox-webapp:<version>`). Starting with `v1.0.0-beta.2`, each tagged release declares a supported upgrade origin — the previously tagged release — and the upgrade path from that origin is verified on the qualification stack. Upgrades from earlier prereleases (`v1.0.0-alpha.*`, `v1.0.0-beta.1`) and version skipping remain unsupported; treat any target revision outside the declared origin as a potentially breaking change and test it against a restored copy of production first.

Releases that change migrations, storage, encryption, or other recovery-critical
behavior must also pass the isolated [Recovery qualification drill](recovery-drill.md).
That runbook proves predecessor restore, candidate upgrade, fresh-install schema
parity, restore-first rollback, and re-upgrade without exposing protected values.

## OIDC identity binding migration (#454)

The OIDC `(issuer, subject)` binding migration creates schema only. It performs no automatic backfill and never guesses a binding from email, username, UPN, tenant,
or an existing AssetHolder. Existing OIDC users therefore require an explicit
`bind_oidc_identity` operation before they can use the new login path. Until that
binding exists, legacy logins fail closed; they do not silently fall back to the
predecessor resolver.

### Forward deployment order

1. Export and protect any operator-approved binding plan separately from the
   database backup. Do not derive one automatically from mutable claims.
2. Apply the candidate schema migration (`users.0103_oidcidentity`) while the
   predecessor application is still stopped or controlled. The predecessor does
   not use the new table.
3. Deploy the candidate application code only after the schema migration has
   completed successfully.
4. Validate the exact configured issuer and subject, then run the explicit
   `bind_oidc_identity --confirm` command for each approved User. Use `--dry-run`
   first and keep the command output sanitized.
5. Admit OIDC traffic only after the required bindings and a login verification
   have been completed. Unbound legacy users continue to fail closed.

### Rollback and irreversible data loss

Reversing `users.0103_oidcidentity` permanently drops every binding created after
this migration. Reverse does not restore, reconstruct, or preserve those rows;
export them first if they must be recreated. A database backup is the preferred
rollback source. Without an export or backup, all bindings must be manually
recreated through the explicit command after a later forward deployment.

If a schema reverse is unavoidable, stop writers, roll back the application code
to the predecessor first, verify that no candidate code can query
`users_oidcidentity`, and only then reverse the migration. Never leave candidate
code running against a database in which the binding table has already been
dropped. A schema reverse while candidate code is active causes missing-table
failures; a code rollback before schema reverse leaves the table unused but
available for recovery.

The predecessor code is not a security-equivalent rollback: once it is serving,
its email/username claim resolution behavior is reopened. That can relink a
login through mutable claims and is the security consequence of rolling back the
binding code. Treat this as a temporary security regression, keep OIDC traffic
blocked unless explicitly accepted, and redeploy the binding code/schema in the
forward order above as soon as possible.

## Report Designer promotion and scheduled deliveries (#565)

The Report Designer was promoted from Beta to Stable and the
`ITAMBOX_FEATURE_REPORT_DESIGNER` activation flag (with its alias
`ITAMBOX_REPORT_DESIGNER_ENABLED`) is removed: designer routes and downloads no
longer require an activation setting. Stable availability must not resume
outbound deliveries that the disabled flag had suppressed, so the upgrade
carries a one-time transition for schedules whose delivery the flag was
skipping:

1. Keep `ITAMBOX_FEATURE_REPORT_DESIGNER` in place through the first upgraded
   start. The transition reads it once to tell an enabled deployment (delivery
   keeps running, nothing changes) from a disabled one; application code
   ignores the variable afterwards, and it can be removed then.
2. On a deployment that ran the designer disabled, the transition pauses
   registered, active, non-grandfathered schedules that were being skipped:
   their django-q row is removed and `is_active` is cleared, while the row, its
   configuration, and its `last_run`/`last_status` history are preserved.
   Grandfathered templates kept delivering under the disabled flag and are not
   touched; already-inactive or unregistered schedules are not touched either.
3. Review **Extras → Scheduled Reports** after the upgrade and re-enable the
   schedules that should resume; reactivating a schedule re-registers its
   django-q row through the normal save path.

### Rollback

The transition migration refuses to reverse: un-pausing by migration could
re-arm deliveries nobody consented to. Roll back by restoring the database
backup taken before the upgrade, or leave the paused schedules in place and
re-enable them explicitly; a code-only rollback keeps the paused state, which
the predecessor application treats as an ordinary inactive schedule.

## Scheduled Reports promotion (#570)

Scheduled Reports is promoted from Beta to Stable and is always available: no
flag, probe, or environment variable switches it on or off. The promotion
activates nothing: no django-q row is created, no `next_run` is written, and no
`is_active` flag is changed by the upgrade. Schedules paused by the #565
transition above stay paused, and schedules that were never registered stay
unregistered until an operator saves or re-enables them. Existing schedules
keep their registration and their next run.

The upgrade also arms the delivery improvements before the first fire:

1. Every registered report schedule row gains the `intended_fire_at` task
   keyword argument, so a broker redelivery is recognized as a duplicate from
   the first fire after the upgrade instead of dispatching a second delivery.
2. Duplicate registration rows for one schedule (possible before registrations
   were race-safe) are collapsed onto the row the schedule references (falling
   back to the oldest), with references to a removed duplicate re-pointed;
   activation state, delivery history, and other schedules are untouched.
3. Archive rows gain the per-target delivery ledger; rows from before the
   upgrade keep a blank ledger and are never rewritten.
4. Each schedule's newest accepted occurrence is registered as a fire record,
   so idempotency stays exact-match per occurrence across the upgrade and an
   older, still-unaccepted occurrence is never dropped behind a newer one.
5. Archive rows gain the generation-scope snapshot (the tenant scope a
   retained file is valid under) and the retry-claim columns; rows from before
   the upgrade keep empty values and are never rewritten.
6. Schedules gain the retry binding that ties **Retry delivery** to the archive
   of the newest completed run; rows from before the upgrade keep an unbound
   (null) reference, so their retry action stays unavailable until the next
   completed run and old failures are recovered with **Run now** instead of a
   stale redelivery.

### Rollback

The migrations reverse cleanly: the ledger, snapshot, claim, and retry-binding
columns are dropped, the fire records are removed with the table that carried them, and
the injected task keyword argument is cleared again, because the predecessor
task signature does not accept it. A code-only rollback without the schema
rollback would leave the keyword argument in place and fail every report fire,
so reverse the migrations (or restore the pre-upgrade backup) when rolling
back. Collapsed duplicate rows are not resurrected.

## Preflight

1. Select and review an exact target commit.
2. Review the repository-root `CHANGELOG.md`, migrations, and configuration changes between the deployed and target commits.
3. Capture the current revision with `git rev-parse HEAD` and retain or export the currently running application image; rebuilding an old commit later may resolve newer base images or dependency versions.
4. Take a complete [database, media, and secret backup](backup-restore.md) and verify that it can be read.
5. Plan a maintenance window; prerelease migrations are not guaranteed to be compatible with the old application.

6. If the target changes the migration baseline, run the read-only recognition
   preflight described below before allowing the candidate to perform any
   migration work.

## Migration baseline recognition preflight

The normalized baseline retains the issue-#88 replacement layer: the historical
migration files are replaced by the 62 replacement shards, which declare the
262 replaced identities through `replaces`. Before any migration work, a
recovery retry, or a cleanup release, run this command against the intended
database from the exact candidate checkout:

```bash
cd itambox
uv run --locked --no-sync python manage.py migration_baseline_preflight --format=json
```

The command reads only first-party migration-recorder rows and the checked
runtime manifest. Exit code `0` attests recorder-row recognition only: it does
not prove schema or data parity and cannot detect rows created with `migrate
--fake`, `--fake-initial`, or direct recorder SQL. Exit code `0` covers two
recognized shapes:

- `current-normalized-baseline`: all replacement rows, their complete
  historical recognition set, and every current post-transition leaf are
  present; no migration action is required.
- `supported-predecessor-pre-squash` and
  `supported-predecessor-transition-release`: the recorder is exactly at one of
  the two supported predecessor states declared in the checked manifest. The
  database is recognized and safe to upgrade with the ordinary migration
  executor; the migration itself is still required.

A non-zero result is a stop condition. It distinguishes a partial normalized
baseline (for example a database that never ran the replacement layer, or only
part of it), an incomplete post-transition state, empty/unmigrated databases,
and unknown or mixed first-party rows — including transitional development
states that are not one of the two declared predecessors. Remediation is to
restore the verified predecessor and investigate the schema/data evidence as
directed by the state.

The command does not validate that an image or running process matches a
caller-declared revision. Bind the exact full Git SHA to the immutable image or
checkout separately. A failed or interrupted migration can have applied
non-atomic operations before its recorder row commits; a missing row therefore
never proves that no schema/data change occurred. Use restore-first rollback and
fresh schema/protected-canary comparisons before retrying.

This prerelease still supports no arbitrary version skipping. The supported
starting points for a release are the previously tagged release — the supported
upgrade-origin chain begins at `v1.0.0-beta.2`, and each release's changelog
states its declared origin — and, in addition, the two predecessor revisions
recorded in the checked manifest (`supported_predecessors`): the pre-squash
revision and the transition release. Databases created by transitional
development states of the #479 work are explicitly not supported; the executor
fails closed with a clear recorder inconsistency instead of rewriting their
history.

## Source-built Compose update

```bash
set -Eeuo pipefail
writers_stopped=false

report_failed_upgrade() {
  rc=$?
  trap - EXIT
  if ((rc != 0)) && [[ "$writers_stopped" == true ]]; then
    echo "Upgrade failed after writers were stopped. Do not admit traffic; inspect the stack and follow the rollback plan." >&2
  fi
  exit "$rc"
}
trap report_failed_upgrade EXIT

# Record the rollback revision before changing the checkout.
ROLLBACK_REVISION=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
printf 'rollback revision: %s\n' "$ROLLBACK_REVISION"

# Fetch and select the reviewed target revision explicitly.
git fetch origin
TARGET_REVISION='full-reviewed-target-commit-sha'
git checkout --detach "$TARGET_REVISION"

# Build the new application and frontend assets from source.
docker compose build --pull

# Stop writers, migrate with the new image, and restart.
writers_stopped=true
docker compose stop app worker
docker compose run --rm app python manage.py migrate
docker compose up -d
writers_stopped=false

# Inspect startup after the deployment.
docker compose ps
docker compose logs --tail=100 app worker
```

`collectstatic` runs while the application image is built, so the included stack does not need a separate post-deployment collection step.

## Post-upgrade notes

Event rule conditions are withdrawn for the 1.0 release. Existing condition JSON
is preserved and remains readable, but rules with authored conditions will not
dispatch. After upgrading, identify affected active rules with:

```bash
python manage.py eventrule_withdrawn_report
```

## Rollback

Do not assume a Django migration can be reversed safely. A migration may be irreversible or may discard data when reversed. The reliable rollback is the complete pre-update set:

1. Stop the application and worker.
2. Restore the retained previous image, or check out and rebuild the recorded previous revision. A rebuild is not necessarily byte-identical when base images or ranged dependencies have moved.
3. Restore the matching database, media, and secrets using [Backup and restore](backup-restore.md).
4. Start the prior application and verify login, attachments, encrypted fields, and background processing.

If an update fails before any migration runs, returning to the previous source revision and rebuilding may be sufficient. Once a migration starts, use the tested backup-based rollback unless that specific migration has been reviewed and proven reversible.

## Identifying the deployed revision

`/api/status/`, the login page, and the application footer report ITAMbox version metadata. That value identifies the declared software version (currently prerelease metadata), not the exact deployed Git commit. Use it as a sanity check and record the source revision separately in the deployment system:

```bash
curl -fsS https://itam.example.com/api/status/
git rev-parse HEAD
git status --short
docker compose images
```

Keep the checkout clean and pin the recorded commit so a later rebuild uses the same source.
