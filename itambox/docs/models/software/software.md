# Software Catalog

The **Software** model tracks software applications, operating systems, and developer tools approved for use inside your organisation (e.g. `Microsoft Office 365`, `Windows 11 Enterprise`, `Adobe Creative Cloud`). Each entry serves as a template under which multiple licenses and installations are tracked.

## Attributes

| Field | Description | Type | Required |

## Tenant Scoping

Software entries can be:
- **Tenant-scoped** (private to a single tenant): name uniqueness is enforced per tenant.
- **Global** (tenant is null): visible to all tenants, with global name uniqueness.

A tenant-owned software product can only be installed on assets of the same tenant; global software can be installed anywhere.

## Derived Counts

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `installed_count` | Number of `InstalledSoftware` instances referencing this catalog entry. |
| `license_count` | Number of active (non-deleted) `License` records linked to this software. |

## SAM Reconciliation

The `reconcile()` method returns a compliance posture snapshot comparing installed instances against entitled seats, producing per-software delta and status indicators (`compliant`, `over_deployed`, or `unlicensed`).

## Relationship to Licenses

Each Software entry is a **catalog definition** — it is distinct from individual licenses and subscriptions. Multiple `License` records (each with seat counts, purchase details, and expiry dates) can reference a single Software entry, enabling SAM (Software Asset Management) reconciliation.
