# Getting Started with ITAMbox Plugins

!!! warning "Status: Experimental"
    Plugins are opt-in and trusted in-process Python code. They are not covered by the Stable 1.0 compatibility promise. Pin both ITAMbox and plugin revisions, and test each combination in a non-production environment before deployment.

ITAMbox has a bounded Experimental plugin system modeled after **NetBox**. The supported API is intentionally small; read the [API Reference](api_reference.md) before writing a plugin. Anything not listed there is private/unstable.

---

## What Can Plugins Do?

The supported ITAMbox-owned surface is intentionally small:

- **Plugin metadata and settings** through the documented `PluginConfig` attributes.
- **UI routes** through the optional package `urls.py` URLconf mounted below the plugin base URL.
- **REST viewsets, menus, menu items, and template content** through the four documented registry extension points.
- **GraphQL** through `PluginConfig.graphql_schema`.
- **Middleware and auxiliary Django apps** through the documented configuration attributes.

A plugin may contain other Django/Python code, including models, but those internals are not additional ITAMbox API guarantees. The package layout below is illustrative; only the symbols and paths named in the [API Reference](api_reference.md) are supported.

```text
itambox_esign/
├── __init__.py           # Declares PluginConfig class
├── urls.py               # Web UI routes (optional)
├── navigation.py         # Sidebar menu registration (optional)
├── template_content.py   # Page template injections (optional)
├── models.py             # Database models (optional)

│   └── schema.py         # GraphQL schema extension (optional)
└── api/
    ├── __init__.py
    └── views.py          # REST API viewsets (optional)
```

## 1. Creating the PluginConfig

The entry point of any plugin is its `__init__.py` which must subclass `PluginConfig` from `itambox.plugins`.

Create `itambox_esign/__init__.py`:

```python
from itambox.plugins import PluginConfig

class EsignPluginConfig(PluginConfig):
    name = 'itambox_esign'
    verbose_name = 'DocuSign Integration'
    version = '1.0.0'
    author = 'DocuSign Dev Team'
    author_email = 'dev@docusign.com'
    min_version = '1.0.0-alpha'  # Version constraint checks
    max_version = '1.99.99'      # Product version, not plugin API version
    min_plugin_api_version = '1.0'
    max_plugin_api_version = '1.0'
    graphql_schema = 'itambox_esign.graphql.schema'  # Optional GraphQL hook

    required_settings = ['DOCUSIGN_API_KEY']
    default_settings = {
        'DOCUSIGN_API_KEY': None,
        'DOCUSIGN_SANDBOX': True,
    }

    def ready(self):
        super().ready()
        # Custom registration logic goes here
        # (e.g. registering template injections, viewsets, menus)

config = EsignPluginConfig
```

---

## 2. Registering the Plugin

To enable your plugin, add its package name to the `ITAMBOX_PLUGINS` environment
variable (comma-separated), or configure it directly in `core/settings/base.py`:

```python
# Environment variable (preferred — survives updates):
# ITAMBOX_PLUGINS=itambox_esign

# Or in code:
PLUGINS = [
    'itambox_esign',
]
```

If your plugin requires custom settings, configure them under `PLUGINS_CONFIG`:

```python
PLUGINS_CONFIG = {
    'itambox_esign': {
        'DOCUSIGN_API_KEY': 'your-api-key-here',
        'DOCUSIGN_SANDBOX': True,
    }
}
```

These settings are deep-merged with your plugin's `default_settings` and made available at runtime via `settings.PLUGINS_RESOLVED_CONFIG['itambox_esign']`.

## Trust and failure behavior

Plugins are trusted, unsandboxed, in-process Django code. They have the same
Python process and database privileges as ITAMbox and may inject middleware.
Installing or enabling a plugin is therefore equivalent to installing trusted
Python code. There is no capability sandbox, signature verification, or
per-tenant activation.

Activation happens only at startup. If a configured plugin is missing,
incompatible, malformed, or raises while composing its hooks, ITAMbox disables
that plugin, keeps Stable core and other valid plugins running, and publishes a
redacted diagnostic in the UI and through `python manage.py plugins`. A failed
plugin contributes no routes, middleware, REST router, GraphQL schema, menu, or
template hook.

Removal and reinstall are manual operations. Removing a name from
`PLUGINS`/`ITAMBOX_PLUGINS` does not remove database tables, ContentTypes,
changelog rows, or referencing configuration. ITAMbox 1.0 deliberately does
not automate orphan-data cleanup. Follow the [plugin removal and recovery
runbook](../operations/plugin-runbook.md).
