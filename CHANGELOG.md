# Changelog

Notable user-visible, operational, compatibility, and security changes to ITAMbox are recorded here. Internal refactors and routine dependency updates are omitted unless they change supported behavior or deployment requirements.

This changelog follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). Public tags use dotted prereleases such as `v1.0.0-alpha.1`; Python metadata maps the same identity to its PEP 440 form (`1.0.0a1`) where required.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `reconcile_procurement_legacy` reports pre-upgrade fulfilment pledges (requests that a partial receipt approved while delivered quantities were still untracked, with a blank `qty_received`); it classifies each pledge individually: candidates are pledges on partially received non-serialised lines whose own allocation exceeds the line's recorded received quantity, while completed records (assigned asset or fully received line) stay untouched and pledges the received units could cover in full, lines without receipt, and serialised lines without an asset require explicit operator review - `--apply` only softly closes the candidates without rewriting any recorded quantity, stock, or approval state; the affected units can be re-requested (issue #569).

### Changed

- **SCIM Provisioning** is promoted from **Beta** to **Stable**: both mounts are always available, the published capability carries no activation probe and no limitations, and the supported SCIM 2.0 subset (endpoints, operations, PATCH paths, filter grammar, error envelopes, and `ServiceProviderConfig`) is frozen for tenant- and provider-scoped mounts (issue #571). Nothing provisions automatically — provisioning still requires an operator-minted, scope-bound, write-enabled token and an identity provider that deliberately calls the mounts, and least-privilege behavior is unchanged. The tenant mount now shares the provider mount's strict request parser: unsupported PATCH operations and paths answer SCIM `400` errors instead of being silently ignored, bracketed `emails[type eq "work"].value` paths are applied, and a rename onto an existing username answers `409` with `scimType: uniqueness` instead of a server error. Deactivate, reactivate, deprovision, and reprovision are frozen as one lifecycle: inactive resources stay addressable and reactivatable on both mounts, and a re-provisioning `POST` restores login without a manual account edit. No schema migration accompanies the promotion; existing `scim_id` / `external_id` mappings, memberships, group rows, and tokens are preserved.
- **Asset Request Procurement Seam** is promoted from **Beta** to **Stable** and becomes always available: manual procurement no longer depends on the optional `ITAMBOX_REQUISITION_AUTO_APPROVAL_THRESHOLDS` setting, which keeps governing automatic approval only. The published capability carries no activation probe and no limitations (issue #569).
- **Webhooks and Event Rules** is promoted from **Beta** to **Stable**: the capability is always available, carries no activation probe, and its envelope contract is graded Stable. Nothing about delivery timing changes — nothing is ever sent until an administrator deliberately creates and enables a webhook endpoint and an event rule; an endpoint alone activates nothing. The published event vocabulary now matches the emitted one: `create`, `update`, `delete`, `restore`, `checkout`, `checkin` (the previously published three-value `core.EventActionChoices` enum was a stale legacy artifact); the vocabulary stays open for additive values in minor releases. The minimal `data` metadata (`app_label`, `model_name`) is stated as the explicit V1 promise — no object snapshot is promised and consumers must tolerate additional members. HMAC signing (`X-Hub-Signature-256`), the reduced Slack/Teams payload guarantees, tenant scoping, SSRF protection, and delivery-history permissions are unchanged. No schema migration accompanies the promotion; existing endpoints, rules, and delivery history are preserved (issue #566).
- Webhook deliveries now retry HTTP **429** responses within the configured retry budget instead of failing terminally, and honor a valid `Retry-After` header (delta-seconds or HTTP-date, capped at 300 seconds, with `0` meaning an immediately due retry) when scheduling the next attempt; absent or invalid headers fall back to the endpoint's normal backoff policy. Pending rate-limited attempts are recorded with the `integration.rate_limited` error class. Redirect (**3xx**) responses are never followed and are recorded as terminal non-deliveries instead of successes, and test sends keep the reserved `event` value `test` while carrying the same minimal `data` metadata as event deliveries (issue #566).
- Promoted the Report Designer from Beta to Stable and made it always available. Its V1 contract for report type, included columns, filters, and grouping is frozen; migrated grandfathered templates keep rendering and are editable through the supported upgrade path (issue #565).
- Removed `ITAMBOX_FEATURE_REPORT_DESIGNER` and its historical alias `ITAMBOX_REPORT_DESIGNER_ENABLED`; designer routes and downloads no longer require an activation flag (issue #565).
- Upgrading a deployment that ran the designer disabled (flag unset or false) pauses registered, active, non-grandfathered schedules that were being skipped: the one-time transition removes their django-q row and keeps every row and its delivery history, and delivery resumes only after an explicit re-enable in **Extras → Scheduled Reports** — so removing the flag cannot silently resume suppressed outbound delivery. Keep `ITAMBOX_FEATURE_REPORT_DESIGNER` in place through the first upgraded start; the transition reads it once and ignores it afterwards (issue #565).
- The **Reporting** menu group no longer carries the Beta badge; with Scheduled Reports also promoted in this release (below), no reporting surface carries a Beta badge anymore (issues #565, #570).
- Report compilation is capped at 500 rows per provider (per catalogue for Hardware Inventory) and discloses capped windows or sample output in rendered files, scheduled mail, and download headers. Machine-format exports remain free of in-file disclosure rows and cover the compiled window; requesting `machine_csv` without machine-export support returns HTTP 400 (issue #565).
- **Alert Rules and Channels** is promoted from **Beta** to **Stable**: the capability is always available, carries no activation probe, and its V1 contract is frozen — six alert types with the documented threshold semantics, daily state-based evaluation, renotification intervals, muting, auto-resolution, and the single-attempt best-effort delivery policy. Stable availability changes nothing about notifications: no alert rule or channel is ever created or enabled automatically, and nothing is delivered until an administrator deliberately creates an active rule with attached, enabled channels. The two former Beta limitations — evaluation is daily rather than continuous, and channel delivery failures are logged rather than retried — are restated as steady-state V1 behavior in the operator guide. No schema migration accompanies the promotion; existing rules, channels, alert history, and delivery state are preserved (issue #567).
- Alert channel delivery now honors the channel **Enabled** flag and the rule's channel scope: a disabled channel is never contacted, and if every attached channel is disabled the alert records an explicit reason with outcome `none` instead of a silently successful delivery. Rules reject channel attachments outside their own scope at the form and API boundaries (a tenant rule accepts only its own tenant's channels; a platform-wide rule only platform-wide channels), and dispatch ignores out-of-scope attachments so a misconfigured row cannot deliver across scopes. The dispatch claim is atomic and leased (15 minutes), so parallel evaluations planning a dispatch for the same alert state deliver exactly once, an in-flight attempt is never re-dispatched by a parallel evaluation, a crashed claim is still recovered after the lease expires, and completion metadata is fenced to the owning delivery id; the alert rule form's channel choices are scoped to the channels the actor can reach. The read-only alert REST endpoints and the delivery-outcome filter are unchanged, and the alert-type vocabulary stays open for additive values in minor releases (issue #567).
- **Scheduled Reports** is promoted from **Beta** to **Stable**: the capability is always available, carries no activation probe, and the V1 scheduling contract is frozen. Supported frequencies are once, hourly, daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly, and custom cron with save-time cron validation. Cadence math runs in the deployment's cluster time zone and preserves the local wall-clock time of daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly cadences across daylight-saving changes; monthly, quarterly, and yearly steps clamp to month ends. After worker downtime, each scheduling pass replays the oldest missed occurrence once before advancing the cadence, the list shows the next run per schedule, cadence edits re-anchor the next run while metadata-only edits keep it, and deactivating removes the background row while reactivating re-registers it. Stable availability activates nothing: no schedule row is created, no next run is rewritten, and schedules that the #565 transition paused stay paused until an operator re-enables them (issue #570).
- Scheduled-report fires are now claimed per exact occurrence time before any work: a broker redelivery, a duplicated queue entry, or a worker restart is a recorded no-op, and an out-of-order replay (a newer occurrence accepted first, as parallel workers can produce) never discards an older, still-unaccepted one. Each run records generation, archive, and per-channel delivery outcomes separately: the archive row carries a per-target delivery ledger (email aggregate plus one entry per notification channel) and a delivery status (`none`, `success`, `partial`, `failed`), the schedule's last status distinguishes `success`, `partial`, and `failed`, and a new **Retry delivery** action re-attempts exactly the targets recorded as failed, replays the recorded original recipients, email subject/body, and notification payloads even if the schedule was edited since, re-validates the archived run's generation scope against the standing approval, is refused while the schedule is inactive, binds to the newest run's own archive (a run that retained no archive is refused instead of redelivering an older report), and serializes parallel attempts with an exclusive, self-expiring claim whose fan-out renews it before every target, aborts once it was lost, and keeps outbound attempts bounded so overlap is limited to a single in-flight send. A file-write failure during archival marks the created archive failed instead of leaving it running, and a failed generation attempts no delivery at all. Schedule-level summary writes are fenced to the newest started run, so an older overlapping occurrence can never overwrite a newer run's status or retry binding, and a retry completion is fenced to its archive still being the newest binding (issue #570).
- The scheduled-reports upgrade carries a non-destructive transition: every registered report schedule row gains the fire-identity task keyword so redelivery is a no-op from the first fire after the upgrade, duplicate registration rows for one schedule are collapsed onto the row the schedule references (falling back to the oldest), with references to a removed duplicate re-pointed, archive rows gain the delivery-ledger columns, each schedule's newest accepted occurrence is registered as a fire record so idempotency stays exact-match per occurrence across the upgrade, and the archive gains the generation-scope snapshot plus the retry-claim columns, and each schedule gains the retry binding that ties **Retry delivery** to the newest run's own archive (pre-promotion rows stay unbound so the action is unavailable until the next completed run; old failures are recovered with **Run now**). Activation state, next-run values, approvals, archives, and other schedules are preserved; the migrations reverse cleanly (the keyword is cleared again because a downgraded task signature does not accept it), and collapsed duplicates are not resurrected (issue #570).

### Fixed

- Partial purchase-order receipts no longer approve every linked request at once: a receipt attributes the delivered quantity per fulfilment link, serialised request units receive exactly one asset per delivered unit and are approved only on full delivery, genuinely quantity-bearing requests (components, accessories, consumables) are approved only once their full reserved quantity has arrived, attribution follows the oldest open request on the line, and surplus units beyond the reserved demand stay as free stock. Cancelling a request closes its still-unreceived fulfilment links while the delivered quantity stays on record and the purchase-order line is left untouched; requests for multiple serialised units can no longer be linked to a purchase order and must be split into request units first. One schema migration adds the per-link received quantity (`FulfillmentLink.qty_received`), blank on links that predate it; those keep their reservation and complete on their next full receipt, so no historical quantities are invented (issue #569).
- Partial-receipt submissions carry a receipt-state snapshot: every receipt states the recorded quantities it was prepared against, and a submission whose lines have moved on (a retry, double-click, replay, or parallel duplicate of the same operation) is refused before anything mutates instead of silently booking additional stock. The receive form binds the snapshot into each rendered form so every submission carries its own copy (a later render, another tab, or another order never re-validates an already-issued submission), and a freshly rendered form can be submitted against the current state; the REST receive action requires the matching `expected_received` field next to `line_quantities` (issue #569).

### Security

- Pinned report scopes are authorized at compile time: one pinned tenant must be within the actor's reach, and multi-tenant scopes require `reports.view_cross_tenant_reports` for every pinned tenant. Unauthorized preview or download returns HTTP 403; scheduled generation is recorded as failed and is not delivered (issue #565).
- Cross-tenant report compilation runs under an explicit authorized scope: the ambient request tenant no longer truncates a pinned constellation before its authorized filter applies, so a single pinned tenant compiles exactly that tenant and an authorized multi-tenant aggregation compiles every pinned tenant; unauthorized constellations still fail closed before any provider runs (issue #565).
- A partially soft-deleted pinned constellation fails closed (HTTP 403) instead of silently compiling a reduced tenant population (issue #565).
- Alert deliveries can no longer cross tenant or platform scopes: dispatch consults only channels inside the rule's own scope, out-of-scope channel attachments are rejected at the form and API write boundaries, and an attachment that could never deliver now fails predictably instead of being silently ignored. In-app recipient lists are likewise bounded at delivery time: explicitly configured recipients receive a notification only inside the channel's scope (tenant members, or staff for a platform-wide channel), and recipients outside the scope are skipped (issue #567).
- The canonical dependency-lockfile security gates now block unsuppressed **MEDIUM** findings in addition to high and critical, and the gate's own default policy matches; low and unknown findings stay visible in the retained results without blocking, and the release-image gates keep their stricter block-on-every-finding (`--fail-on any`) policy (issue #568).
- The frontend build toolchain's `undici` override moved to `6.28.1`, clearing the `CVE-2026-85024` denial-of-service advisory retained as Code Scanning alert #140; dependency findings now bind to the tracked lockfile paths in Code Scanning instead of a synthetic scanner-side directory (issue #568).
- Code Scanning merge protection now requires CodeQL results for pull requests targeting `main`: a new security alert at medium or higher — or a new error-level alert — blocks the merge until it is fixed or dismissed through the reviewed false-positive process, so a successful analysis run no longer implies a clean security state (issue #568).
- The canonical dependency locks moved to the advisory set's first patched releases: `pyjwt` `2.13.0` → `2.14.0` in the Python lockfile (clearing all ten CVEs, the release-image set included) and `brace-expansion` `5.0.9` → `5.0.12` / `fast-uri` `3.1.7` → `3.1.8` in the frontend lockfile, clearing the 14 dependency-gate and 10 release-image findings that a 2026-09-30 Trivy advisory-database update introduced and that blocked the gates repo-wide — `main` included — without gate-policy or suppression changes (issue #579).

## [1.0.0-beta.3] - 2026-09-28

### Changed

- Release images are published as a multi-platform index with `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` variants instead of an amd64-only image, so ARM64 hosts can pull the official tag directly; the release workflow builds both platforms from one reviewed commit, verifies both platform manifests fail-closed, and boot-checks both platform images before the draft release is prepared (issue #549).
- The frontend build toolchain migrated from Node.js 20 to Node.js 26: the `stylelint`, `frontend`, and E2E CI jobs, the runner-validation workflow, the production image's frontend build stage (`node:26-slim`), and the contributor prerequisites in `CONTRIBUTING.md` now use Node.js 26.
- Dashboard charts (asset status distribution and asset age distribution) are rendered with Apache ECharts instead of ApexCharts; categories, colors, tooltips, legends, empty states, light and dark theming, and the behavior across HTMX swaps and GridStack resizes are preserved, and crowded category labels rotate on narrow widgets the way the previous engine rotated them. The chart code is bundled locally with no runtime downloads and no CSP exception was added, and the ApexCharts dependency and its vendored script are removed entirely.

### Fixed

- Corrected the maturity statements in the documentation index and the SaaS Subscriptions model page to the declared capability grades: SaaS Subscriptions and Purchase Orders and Contracts are Stable; the report designer, scheduled reports, alert rules, webhooks, the Asset Request procurement seam, and SCIM provisioning remain Beta; the plugin system remains Experimental. No declared capability grade changed; only the published documentation was corrected.

### Security

- The published image installs the current `openssl`, `libssl3`, and `tzdata` security builds in its runtime stage instead of inheriting the stale base-image pins, clearing the medium- and low-severity findings that remained from the `v1.0.0-beta.2` image scan.
- The release gates now block on every unsuppressed image finding (`--fail-on any`) instead of only high and critical findings, so a cut can only pass from a scan-clean candidate; governed suppressions remain the only exception.
- A scheduled drift scan rebuilds and rescans the current `main` image weekly, so new advisories surface between releases instead of only at the next release gate.

### Known limitations and upgrade requirements

- The supported upgrade origin for this release is `v1.0.0-beta.2`. Version skipping remains unsupported, and the earlier prereleases (`v1.0.0-alpha.*`, `v1.0.0-beta.1`) are not supported origins — run `migration_baseline_preflight` from the exact candidate checkout before any migration work.

## [1.0.0-beta.2] - 2026-09-27

### Added

- The Asset Type Library was finalized on the specification model: asset types compose an explicit, ordered list of fieldsets and fields with per-target applicability, the type-library vocabulary is pinned to a canonical core set, and the runtime serves exactly this vocabulary with no development-era compatibility layer left (issue #479).
- Repair/replacement stories can be reconstructed as episodes: link maintenance records, reservations, and disposals to a repair episode (an asset plus an optional loaner/substitute) and read the grouped story on the asset detail Timeline tab (issue #504).
- Asset holders gain a read-only **Offboarding** tab that gathers everything a departing person still holds across assets, inventory, licenses, custody receipts, subscriptions, and memberships; it replaces the removed `offboard_user.py` helper (issue #498).
- Tagged releases now also publish the official container image to the GitHub Container Registry at `ghcr.io/itambox/itambox-webapp:1.0.0-beta.2`: the release workflow pushes the exact image it built, scanned, archived, and SBOM-validated, verifies the registry digest against that image, and attaches build provenance and the SPDX SBOM to it as OCI attestations. The downloadable archive, the standalone SBOM, and the registry image all describe the same reviewed commit.

### Changed

- Merged `subscriptions.Provider` into the shared `assets.Supplier` catalogue, now scoped by tenant or tenant group with null representing global scope; moved portal, account, and active fields onto suppliers, and made subscriptions reference suppliers directly with an optional procurement contract link. The cutover is a deterministic, upgrade-only migration with no compatibility aliases. This is a breaking prerelease change (issue #508).
- Added supplier links for SaaS subscriptions and asset warranties, documented when to use Contracts versus Subscriptions, and distinguished agreement entitlement quantities from linked-license seat counts in subscription details and reports (issue #500).
- Added the read-only `migration_baseline_preflight` release gate and checked manifest. The gate recognizes the current normalized baseline and the two supported predecessor states (`supported-predecessor-pre-squash`, `supported-predecessor-transition-release`) as exit-0 outcomes; partial, old, or mixed states are rejected before a cleanup attempt, and restore-first handling for interrupted non-atomic migrations is documented.
- Normalized the migration history for the #479 release: the two #479 development waves and the replaced issue-#88 originals are gone, fresh installs and both supported predecessors (pre-squash and transition release) migrate to the same final schema, and the checked baseline manifest moves to the normalized layout (issue #479). The supported-upgrade qualification driver is checked in at `scripts/qualification/migrations/run-supported-upgrade-p1p2.sh`.
- Forwarded client-IP handling is explicit and opt-in in production: `ITAMBOX_RATELIMIT_USE_X_FORWARDED_FOR` and `ITAMBOX_RATELIMIT_NUM_PROXIES` configure trusted-proxy client IPs, while directly reachable deployments stay fail-closed.
- Release preparation from `main` now requires the app-owned end-to-end qualification suite to pass on the dispatched commit before the draft release is prepared.
- Scope switching preserves list context: search, filters, and paging survive a switch, scope-bound filters are dropped with a visible notice instead of an empty list, a switch from an object page lands on the list instead of a 404, and aggregate bulk confirmations name each object's tenant. The platform-wide scope is labelled **All Tenants** (superusers: **Global View**), and users can choose a personal default workspace for a tenant, tenant group, or aggregate view (issue #499).
- Tightened the first organization/membership English copy: role-form guidance, the assign-users explanation, member-selection help, role presets, and user-group help are shorter and more direct; the role assignment page and the permissions-matrix help now render reviewed German translations (part of issue #386).
- The first German asset UI text chunk uses the established glossary terms and clearer labels for asset types, locations, custody receipts, and warranties.
- Tightened the first English asset/request text slice: selection errors, request labels, custody notifications, disposal guidance, and bulk receiving copy are shorter and more direct without changing behavior.
- The desktop footer keeps its timestamp and version stamp without the optional Tabler theme credit; the full application footer is hidden below the mobile action-bar breakpoint.

### Fixed

- The demo seed dataset now tells stories the product can actually produce: a received purchase-order line materialises an asset for every unit it reports, a repair episode is preceded by the check-in that removed the device from its holder (and the device is handed back afterwards with the status it had before the re-checkout), out-of-service maintenance documents a repair window the asset's own change log recorded, and an approved asset request always carries a tenant and an allocated unit that is actually claimable. Repaired units are no longer left stranded in a repair episode whose window never closed, and seeded assignments can no longer run backwards, start before their asset was bought, or return from the future. The self-check reads a repair window from the repair label itself rather than the `pending` meta-type that In Transit and Quarantined share, closes the window at the transition that leaves repair instead of at the asset's last change of any kind, and treats an assignment that overlaps the window at any point as a contradiction rather than only one open when it began; a unit already allocated to an open request is left unreserved so that a reservation for a different holder cannot dead-end the claim. A seed self-check fails closed when any of these regresses (issue #506).
- The demo seed writes no placeholder signature payloads for accepted custody receipts, and the full-seed qualification covers the custody-receipt story end to end (issue #407).
- Disposal history is preserved through explicit cancellation: a cancelled disposal keeps its record with reason, actor, and timestamp, the asset returns to Pending, a later disposal becomes a new historical record, and effective report totals exclude cancelled rows while the history stays visible (issue #496).
- The dashboard target picker offers every canonically authorized live tenant (including managed-only MSP reach), renders each target independently of the ambient tenant, and fails closed for inaccessible, deleted, or revoked targets instead of falling back to ambient data (issue #447).
- The asset creation form now accepts a blank asset tag and generates one from the tag sequence on save, matching the model contract and the PO receiving, bulk receive, import, and clone paths (issue #503).
- Scan baskets now report an EAN that maps to several assets distinctly instead of claiming no asset matches, directing the operator to scan the asset tag (issue #502).
- Subscription annual cost now annualizes multi-year terms over their length and one-time purchases are labeled as a one-time cost instead of occupying the annual slot; zero-cost subscriptions display `0.00` instead of an omitted row or "Not set" (issue #501).
- Component Allocation create and asset quick-add are now explicitly target-only, reject silently ignored source locations, return observable HTMX success/errors, count source-backed Component checkouts only once in availability, and keep component/source/destination immutable on update (issue #393).
- Tenant-scoped pages purge pre-existing HTMX session history snapshots and no longer save new ones, preventing stale asset actions from targeting objects outside the current server-side scope or retaining tenant DOM after a workspace switch (issue #419).
- Asset list pagination now limits assignee resolution and tenant-scoped related-manager work to the rendered page instead of evaluating every asset in the active scope (issue #416).
- Asset edits no longer clear purchase and in-service dates when localized HTML5 date controls are submitted after changing the tenant, location, or another field (issue #391).
- Managed-tenant onboarding now gives the creating provider administrator explicit administrator reach and switches directly into the new tenant without adding a customer membership.
- Tenant creation now exposes only object-authorized live provider tenants to eligible non-superusers, requires an explicit provider when one is available, and uses the same onboarding projection for normal and managed-tenant routes (issue #405).
- Asset reservation quick-add now preserves a native POST fallback from asset detail pages instead of submitting a GET request (issue #390).
- List page refreshes no longer emit an HTMX `htmx:oobErrorNoTarget` console error when the applied-filter count badge is updated: the filter-toggle badge now carries the `filters-applied-count` target id that the list refresh out-of-band swap expects, so applying, clearing, loading, or saving list filters update the visible count cleanly (issue #421).
- Bulk check-in, check-out, and disposal keep their pre-seeded baskets when a target tenant is selected in an aggregate scope; every submitted asset is validated as a live asset of the bound tenant before any job is created, and job lists and cancellation follow the accessible-tenant scope in aggregate scopes (issue #424).
- Non-staff users with tenant-scoped asset request permissions can now see and use their authorized actions consistently in tenant, tenant group, and All-accessible scopes: fulfilment actors record the handover from the request detail page, the bulk-receipt toolbar follows the per-request decision, and malformed or repeated selections report a message instead of an access-denied page (issue #497).
- Asset request fulfilment consumes exactly one request unit per physical handover and distinguishes explicit completion from the recorded handover, so concurrent handovers cannot claim more than the request holds (issues #492, #493).
- Assigning an asset to a person preserves the asset's recorded base location (issue #494).
- Hardware-kit checkout follows the individual asset obligations: explicit device selection per kit row, all-or-nothing allocation that never silently substitutes a conflicting device, and owner-derived availability for tenant-owned kits (issues #495, #523, #524).
- Managed core/library definitions — custom fields and custom fieldsets — render their labels as names and hide mutation actions they do not support; bulk edit is unavailable on definition lists while changelog access and permitted local actions remain (issues #516, #518).
- Bulk asset-label jobs isolate their notifications per job and keep the job's scope, label PDFs stay downloadable from their notifications, and PDF generation failures report their actual phase instead of a single generic error (issue #453).
- Event dispatch now preserves the identity of deleted objects after the transaction commits, so event rules and webhooks receive coherent records for deletions.
- Unset optional table values render as an en dash instead of a placeholder label.

### Security

- OIDC sign-in now resolves users through a persisted, exact `(issuer, subject)` identity binding: plausible legacy email/username candidates fail closed, there is no automatic backfill, and existing OIDC users require an explicit `bind_oidc_identity` operator step (issue #454).
- Production startup now enforces the operator-documented configuration contract: a development secret-key fallback is rejected with Django `security.W009` parity, and a malformed `ITAMBOX_API_TOKEN_PEPPERS` value aborts startup instead of silently disabling token peppers.
- Job attachment downloads resolve through the canonical active-scope job visibility policy before the object-bound permission check (issue #459).
- Upgraded `djangorestframework` to 3.17.2, `pypdf` to 6.17.0, and `fast-uri` to 3.1.7 to address open dependency advisories.
- Upgraded `sqlparse` to 0.6.0 to address CVE-2026-54284, CVE-2026-59893, CVE-2026-59894, and CVE-2026-71491.
- Secret-scan suppressions are now keyed to a commit-independent file/rule/line identity, so squash, rebase, or cherry-pick integrations no longer invalidate reviewed suppressions; the previously ungoverned historical placeholder findings in the pre-rename tree are governed as well (issue #510).
- Release artifacts now include a generated SPDX SBOM and a build-provenance attestation that binds the archived release image to the repository, the reviewed commit, and the release workflow.

### Known limitations and upgrade requirements

- Supported upgrade origins for this release are the two predecessor revisions recorded in the checked migration manifest (pre-squash and transition release). Version skipping remains unsupported, and databases created by transitional development states are not recognized — run `migration_baseline_preflight` from the exact candidate checkout before any migration work.
- The supplier consolidation (issue #508) is an upgrade-only cutover with no compatibility aliases; rolling it back in place is not supported — restore the verified predecessor backup instead.
- OIDC identity bindings are not backfilled: existing OIDC users require an explicit `bind_oidc_identity --confirm` before the new login path works, and rolling back the binding code temporarily reopens mutable-claim resolution — treat the predecessor code as a security-relevant, transitional rollback target and follow the upgrade guide.
- Capabilities graded Beta or Experimental keep their documented caveats: their interfaces may still change before the stable release. Maturity grades never waive tenant isolation or security requirements.

## [1.0.0-beta.1] - 2026-08-16

### Added

- Scheduled reports with a cross-tenant scope now have an operator approval workflow: the schedule list shows the scope approval state, and a dedicated Scope Approval page approves or revokes the durable authorization (`reports.view_cross_tenant_reports`). Revocation keeps the approval history and fails delivery closed until a fresh approval covers the full scope.
- Resource grants can expire: expiry dates drive a system revocation sweep, and a scoped audit API exposes the grant-expiry history (issue #195).
- Webhook delivery is durable and observable: deliveries run through a state machine with retry handling and typed per-attempt outcomes instead of fire-and-forget sends (PR #349).
- The production GraphQL surface enables schema introspection for authenticated users and exposes an authenticated GraphiQL interface (PRs #372, #376).

### Changed

- The report-designer opt-in flag is now `ITAMBOX_FEATURE_REPORT_DESIGNER`; `ITAMBOX_REPORT_DESIGNER_ENABLED` remains a deprecated 1.x fallback. When the flag is off, scheduled delivery is skipped for non-grandfathered templates, while the migration-managed bounded grandfathered set continues to render and deliver; grandfathered templates are read-only until the designer is enabled.
- Event Rule conditions were withdrawn for 1.0: unsupported conditions fail closed and existing rows are preserved (issue #187).
- Alert-channel delivery now records typed, observable outcomes per delivery attempt (issue #185).
- Tenant-surface SCIM group reads require the `users.view_usergroup` permission (issue #193).
- Accessibility was qualified across full-page and HTMX interaction journeys, and the remaining review gaps were closed (issue #101).
- The runtime image refreshes its CA-certificate bundle during the build (issue #370).

### Fixed

- API token lifecycle: the key is shown once at creation, responses carry ETags, deletion works without a queryset, owner transfer returns 200, and creation without an active tenant fails closed (issues #341, #353).
- User configuration and asset-tag-sequence endpoints reject unknown request fields instead of silently ignoring them (issue #344, PR #354).
- `OPTIONS` on collection endpoints no longer raises 500 (issue #340).
- API root and API namespace root discovery return 200 for authenticated users instead of 500 (issues #345, #363).
- Scanner lookup resolves across all accessible tenants and accepts EAN/GTIN codes in every scan flow (issue #367).
- Frontend: page headers stack actions on mobile, the mobile header/footer order and sidebar search are corrected, the dashboard switcher aligns with the action row, and mobile dashboard changelog cards carry field headings (PRs #365, #366, #368, #373, issue #374).

### Security

- Dashboard creation through the API sets the owner from the request context and rejects owner spoofing (PR #352).
- The runtime image pins a patched nanoid dependency instead of the vulnerable override.

## [1.0.0-alpha.3] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- Added a shared typed external-integration error contract with retryable/terminal classification, safe user messages, bounded Graph retry handling, structured tenant/actor/request context, and documented follow-up boundaries for other adapters.
- Added the versioned webhook envelope v1 with additive `schema_version`, `event_id`, `delivery_id`, `attempt`, and owning-`tenant` fields across generic, Slack, and Teams payloads; strict additional-property validators must update their schemas.
- Published the 1.x compatibility, deprecation, and support policy together with a bounded external-contract inventory covering REST/GraphQL/SCIM surfaces, the webhook envelope, persisted choice values, contract-bearing settings, permission codenames, UI URL namespaces, and each capability's contract class and exclusions. A stdlib gate derives every enumerated surface from source and fails when the published contract and the code disagree.
- Added explicit Purchase Order lifecycle endpoints at `/api/procurement/purchase-orders/{id}/approve/`, `/order/`, `/receive/`, `/cancel/`, and `/reopen/`.
- Published the bounded procurement Stable qualification matrix, including existing UI, REST, service, tenant, permission, audit, currency, and PostgreSQL concurrency guarantees plus the deliberately absent surfaces.
- Added explicit, opt-in Event retention controlled by `ITAMBOX_EVENT_RETENTION_DAYS`, with observable pruning of expired events.
- Added opaque SCIM resource IDs and per-domain scoped `externalId` values; the previous identifier scheme remains readable through a 1.x dual-read window.

### Changed

- Intune discovery now records typed integration failures with safe user-facing messages and structured tenant-scoped job-log context; optional detected-software degradation is explicit in the completed result as `software_degraded`.
- Qualified the four-state Subscription lifecycle as Stable across model, UI, REST, GraphQL, import/export, assignment, seat-accounting, and daily-task boundaries, including idempotent retries and model-level tenant validation.
- Subscription status is now a closed four-state lifecycle (`active`, `suspended`, `cancelled`, `expired`) driven by explicit UI, REST, GraphQL, admin, and background actions. The canonical renewal-term field is `vendor_contract_auto_renews`; `auto_renewal` remains a 1.x read/write API compatibility alias.
- Purchase Order `status` and Purchase Order Line `qty_received` are read-only in the REST schema. API clients must use the corresponding lifecycle endpoint: differing direct writes now return HTTP 400 with sanctioned-action guidance, while identical values remain accepted and ignored for full-representation PUT compatibility. Existing rows require no migration.
- Asset Request auto-approval and the Beta Asset Request procurement seam are now opt-in through `ITAMBOX_REQUISITION_AUTO_APPROVAL_THRESHOLDS`; fresh deployments leave requests pending. The legacy setting name remains a deprecated 1.x fallback with a startup warning.
- Alert rules with no configured channels now deliver nowhere instead of implicitly fanning out to every enabled tenant or tenant-less channel; platform-global in-app delivery remains explicit.
- Closed the Event action vocabulary: `EventRule.events` is validated against the supported action set ahead of the 1.0 contract freeze.
- Scheduled reports are gated on the report designer opt-in: with the designer disabled, the navigation entry is hidden, all scheduled-report routes return 404, and the background task fails closed while preserving saved rows.
- Completed the zero-error OpenAPI generation contract and the generated-client compatibility check.
- Updated locked runtime dependencies to redis-py 8.1 and django-redis 7.0.

### Fixed

- Made invalid generic list filters fail closed to an empty result while retaining field-level validation errors across full-page, HTMX, direct-query, and saved-filter requests.
- Serialized concurrent Purchase Order approvals so only one draft-to-approved transition succeeds, and preserved the Purchase Order currency on assets materialized by receiving.
- Scheduled-report runs now preserve their failure status and the original exception, keeping failed deliveries observable.
- Corrected the alert-channel delivery documentation to match shipped behavior (synchronous, single-attempt delivery).
- Made SCIM capability metadata truthful: removed the fake HTTP Basic capability, fixed `User.lastModified` handling, and wired request-id propagation.
- Custom (non-CRUD) permissions declared via `Meta.permissions` are now exposed in the role editor, making actions such as preparing and exporting custody receipts grantable through the UI.
- A valid signing session now overrides the seven-day custody bearer-link TTL, restoring assisted handoff on receipts older than seven days.
- Fixed custody handoff UI issues: QR codes have a proper quiet zone, the handoff panel is mobile-safe, actions wrap on small screens, Bootstrap collapses rebind after HTMX swaps, copy feedback is sticky with a clipboard fallback, and custody export links are no longer htmx-boosted.
- Fixed frontend issues: app-external links (docs, API, GraphQL, admin) are no longer htmx-boosted, the report preview button no longer leaks across pages, theme-token changelog panels and mobile stacking render correctly, Purchase Order and Resource Grant labels are localized, the responsive asset shell cleanup is complete, and scanner camera detections are throttled through one shared gate.

### Security

- Hardened the Intune Graph boundary against cross-registration token-cache reuse, bearer forwarding through redirects or untrusted `@odata.nextLink` hosts, provider-controlled device-ID path pivots, stale token lifetimes, and credential/payload leakage in exception and job logs.
- Added cross-tenant read/write matrices for contracts, Purchase Orders, and Purchase Order lines together with real two-connection receipt and approval race tests.
- Centralized Asset Request-to-Purchase Order linking in a tenant-locked, permission-checked, idempotent service and made failed UI linking roll back the new purchase order.
- Removed the unused global pip installation and ensurepip bootstrap from the production runtime image, with build-time checks that the copied runtime environment remains pip-free, while preserving locked uv-based dependency resolution in the builder.
- Global cross-tenant report aggregation is now permission-gated; the curated built-in report contract remains unchanged.
- Froze and proved the tenant resource-grant security boundary with cross-tenant read/write matrices and adversarial coverage.
- Removed the remaining unsafe-inline style dependency from the Content Security Policy and restored runtime dashboard styles under the hardened policy.
- Remediated the dependency security-gate findings in the locked dependency set.

## [1.0.0-alpha.2] - 2026-07-28

### Added

- Added deterministic CI ratchets for test coverage and certification, changed-code coverage, local imports, exception handling, OpenAPI diagnostics, architecture layers, and import cycles. Existing debt is explicit and cannot grow silently.
- Added an architecture decision record and contributor guidance for module layers, approved import directions, inline-import annotations, exception boundaries, and the supported public plugin API.
- Added focused security and authorization regression coverage for generic views, membership and role-grant services, login and tenant SSO entry points, inventory stock actions, and asset-form scoping.

### Changed

- Standardized Python formatting and import ordering with Ruff, reduced selected function complexity, and paid down selected findings while preserving the existing deterministic flake8 no-growth ratchet.
- Stabilized generic detail, list, create, edit, delete, and service-action views around fail-closed authorization checks, and standardized HTMX success responses for restore and service actions.
- Extracted membership and role-grant operations from presentation forms into explicit organization services with tenant-, container-, and delegated-scope enforcement.
- Consolidated accessory, consumable, and component stock actions on shared transactional services and authorization checks.
- Decomposed `AssetForm` initialization into focused collaborators while preserving tenant scoping, initial-value precedence, and validation behavior.
- Made OpenAPI generation deterministic and checked in the canonical schema plus a warning/error identity baseline.
- Made the daily subscription expiry/reminder task enumerate all tenants and use the local date, avoiding tenant omissions and one-day boundary drift.
- Updated locked dashboard and Django integration dependencies to GridStack 13.1.2, django-filter 26.1, django-htmx 1.28.0, and django-otp 1.7.0; refreshed frontend build and browser-test tooling and added browser coverage for GridStack initialization, resizing, and persisted layouts.

### Fixed

- Hardened login and tenant SSO entry points against stale tenant selection, unsafe fallback behavior, ambiguous provider routing, and signing-algorithm drift; corrected the documented tenant OIDC routes.
- Replaced security-sensitive silent exception handling with explicit, justified boundary behavior and a blocking policy gate.
- Removed an accidental internal gap report from release source archives.
- Updated PostCSS and brace-expansion dependencies past their reported security advisories.

### Security

- Added fail-closed authorization tests around shared action views, membership and RBAC mutations, tenant selection, SAML POST handling, and OIDC provider validation.
- Escaped configurable `AssetForm` tag-prefix help text so crafted values cannot break HTML attributes or inject active SVG markup.
- Made `domain-model -> presentation` imports unconditionally forbidden and made new module-top or deferred import cycles fail CI.
- Required every retained broad/silent exception, local import, cycle, and cross-layer dependency in the scanned production scope to carry a reviewable identity or inline justification.

### Known limitations and upgrade requirements

- The architecture, exception, local-import, OpenAPI, lint, and coverage baselines intentionally freeze pre-existing debt; they prevent growth but do not claim that the recorded debt is already removed.
- Upgrades from deployments that used arbitrary passphrases in `ITAMBOX_FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEYS` must carry forward the exact previously derived Fernet key. Substituting a replacement key makes existing encrypted secrets unreadable; follow the installation guide before deploying this alpha.
- `ITAMBOX_TENANT_LDAP_CONFIGS`, `ITAMBOX_TENANT_SAML_CONFIGS`, `ITAMBOX_TENANT_OIDC_CONFIGS`, and `ITAMBOX_TENANT_INTUNE_CONFIGS` must contain JSON objects. Malformed JSON or non-object values now stop startup with `ImproperlyConfigured` instead of silently disabling the integration configuration.
- Review tenant-specific SAML and OIDC mappings before upgrading. SAML requests now require a live, configured tenant; a `default` SAML configuration is accepted only when exactly one live tenant makes it unambiguous, and missing, deleted, or inactive tenant bindings return 404.
- SaaS subscriptions, procurement, reporting, webhooks and event rules, SCIM, and the plugin lifecycle remain Beta. Their interfaces may change during the prerelease series.
- Alpha upgrades may include breaking migrations. No general version-skipping policy exists yet; review and test the exact target revision with a complete backup and rollback plan.
- The full pytest suite is not safe to run with `pytest-xdist`; use the default serial configuration.
- SQLite is not supported. PostgreSQL 15 or newer is required for development, tests, and production.

## [1.0.0-alpha.1] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- Multi-tenant asset lifecycle management for catalogues, assignments, check-in and check-out, reservations, warranties, maintenance, depreciation, disposal, and total cost history.
- Location-aware stock management for accessories, consumables, components, and kits, including barcode and QR workflows and transactional bulk operations.
- Software catalogues, installed-software records, license-seat management, suppliers, and cost centers.
- Beta subscription and procurement workflows for SaaS subscriptions, purchase orders and lines, contracts, and Asset Request fulfillment links.
- Custody receipts, digital sign-off, audit campaigns, reconciliation reports, frozen audit evidence, and CSV export.
- Tenant roles, tenant groups, delegated resource grants, scoped administration, and provenance-aware sharing for managed-service-provider environments.
- Search, tags, custom fields, saved filters, journals, attachments, labels, dashboards, reports, alerts, notification channels, event rules, and webhooks.
- REST APIs with OpenAPI, Swagger UI, and ReDoc; a scoped GraphQL schema with depth and field-count limits.
- LDAP, SAML, and OIDC sign-in; TOTP for privileged local accounts; Microsoft Intune discovery sync; and Beta SCIM 2.0 provisioning. Tenant endpoints expose Groups read-only; provider-scoped endpoints provision provider-owned Groups.
- Import and export tooling, including a Snipe-IT migration command, model-aware CSV import, and reusable export templates.
- django-q2 background jobs with tenant and user attribution, job monitoring, pending-job cancellation, retries, and retention controls. Running jobs cannot be forcibly stopped.
- A Beta plugin framework with UI, API, navigation, alert, and GraphQL extension points.
- German localization and progressive-web-app metadata for installable browser experiences.
- A production-oriented Docker Compose stack with PostgreSQL, Valkey, an application worker, health checks, a mandatory production secret-key check, and an isolated smoke test.
- MkDocs operator, integration, model, plugin, and developer documentation, including generated data-model diagrams and a release checklist.

### Changed

- Replaced legacy role assignments with the canonical `RoleGrant` and `RoleGrantScope` authorization model, including explicit cross-tenant scopes. This is a breaking prerelease data-model change.
- Standardized generic object detail, edit, and delete routes on numeric primary keys; integration routes may continue to use slugs where their contracts require them.
- Moved shared API infrastructure to `itambox.api` and standardized tenant-aware REST behavior.
- Standardized HTMX navigation, partial rendering, modal actions, toast events, and table refresh behavior.
- Made PostgreSQL mandatory in every environment and moved production cache, rate-limit, and SAML replay state to a shared Valkey or Redis backend. django-q2 continues to use PostgreSQL's ORM broker.
- Standardized direct Python dependencies in `pyproject.toml` with an exact cross-platform `uv.lock`; CI, contributors, documentation, and Docker now consume the same locked resolution. ITAMbox remains intentionally non-packageable.
- Added explicit Stable and Beta maturity labels so prerelease compatibility expectations are visible per module.

### Removed

- Removed the legacy tenant-invitation flow in favor of explicit membership and provisioning workflows.
- Consolidated the former MSP `Provider` model and dashboard into the tenant tree and scoped RBAC model.
- Removed the former `core.api` compatibility shim after moving shared API infrastructure to `itambox.api`.
- Removed legacy configuration-context behavior that no longer matched the tenant and custom-field model.

### Fixed

- Enforced data-integrity rules for active assignments, license seats, reservation overlap, soft-delete uniqueness, proceeds, and tenant-group cycles.
- Corrected tenant scope restoration, accessible-scope caching, bulk permission checks, and delegated-resource revocation edge cases.
- Made LDAP and file validation fail safely when native dependencies are unavailable on Windows.
- Restored production Docker startup checks, worker validation, PWA installability, Playwright preflight behavior, and mobile header layout.
- Updated list filtering for django-tables2 3 query-string behavior and removed legacy slug-routing fallbacks from generic UI views.
- Corrected production cache configuration and added warnings for unsafe per-process cache use in multi-worker deployments.
- Added concurrency and database constraints for workflows that previously allowed conflicting assignments, reservations, or allocations.

### Security

- Added object-level tenant enforcement and adversarial coverage for UI, REST, GraphQL, import, bulk-action, attachment, and download boundaries.
- Hardened tenant and delegated-resource authorization, role editing, privilege changes, background-task context, and API-token permission evaluation.
- Stored API tokens as peppered hashes and supported pepper rotation without retaining plaintext tokens.
- Encrypted SMTP passwords, license keys, and webhook secrets with the rotatable `ITAMBOX_FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEYS` Fernet keyring; development installs without a configured keyring fall back to a `SECRET_KEY`-derived key.
- Blocked webhook SSRF, including redirects, private and link-local targets, and DNS-rebinding attempts.
- Added TOTP enforcement for privileged local accounts, login rate limits, SAML replay protection, secure upload and archive validation, and a nonce-based script Content Security Policy.
- Hardened CSV output, redirect validation, and template rendering against formula injection, open redirects, and cross-site scripting.
- Added deterministic, attributed change records and configurable retention or legal holds for operational audit data.

### Known limitations

- SaaS subscriptions, procurement, reporting, webhooks and event rules, SCIM, and the plugin lifecycle remain Beta. Their interfaces may change during the prerelease series.
- This alpha establishes the first compatibility baseline. Until the draft release is reviewed and published, evaluate and deploy only from a pinned source revision.
- Alpha upgrades may include breaking migrations. No general version-skipping policy exists yet; review and test the exact target revision with a complete backup and rollback plan.
- The full pytest suite is not safe to run with `pytest-xdist`; use the default serial configuration.
- SQLite is not supported. PostgreSQL 15 or newer is required for development, tests, and production.
